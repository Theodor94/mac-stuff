# macOS Utility Scripts

A curated set of personal shell scripts created for macOS (tested on Apple Silicon).  
These scripts help automate system cleanup, uninstall routines, orphaned file scans, and various other diagnostic tasks.

All scripts are lightweight, portable, and written for terminal users who value control and clarity.
